    "## SimPy Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "SimPy has a few basic concepts to let you perform event-based simulation:\n",
    "1. **Environment:** think of this as \"the world\" in which your simulation occurs\n",
    "2. **Event:** an event that occurs in the environment -- it can be a happening, from time ticking to an action occurring\n",
    "3. **Process:** described by Python generator functions -- they create events and `yield` (yeet) them out to the world\n",
    "4. **Timeout:** a special time-based event, that describes how long it takes for an event to occur (assumed units)\n",
    "5. **Resource:** an object representing a resource that can be acquired or released by Processes (gas station with limited fuel pumps)\n",
    "6. **Container:** an object representing a resource that can be produced or consumed (like electrical power or apples)\n",
    "7. **Store:** an object representing a store that can replenish or sell its items (dynamic quantities)\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that is key about event-based simulation is that, much like embedded systems, all processes are **interruptible** by priority, meaning that processes can be at different priorities (just like real life).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to yield multiple events (actions) at a time, use the `&` operator.  If you need to yield at least one event (whichever event is closest), use the `|` operator."
