    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will practice applying your frequentist inference and regression modeling skills on different datasets. Like the previous homework, this set of problems will be presented as datasets and associated research questions for you to answer with your own Markdown and Python Code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rubric for this homework\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make sure you write down the statistical reasoning and justification for any Python code cells created.**  The Python code is only there to support you computationally for your own statistical hypotheses and analyses. Additionally, make sure to justify any conclusions you make to answer questions with statistical reasoning.  Make sure you justify the statistical test chosen as well (for instance, unpaired vs. paired t-test).\n",
